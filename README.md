Unity Version 2021.3.45f1

## Including Cubemap files for the Skybox
This project uses the ["Real Stars Skybox Lite"](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/real-stars-skybox-lite-116333#content) package from the Unity Asset Store.
The .cubemap files in this asset are too large for GitHub, so you will need download and update the package locally.

## Streaming Output via NDI
To view the full dome output outside of Unity and in full screen, you will need to install [NDI Tools](https://ndi.video/tools/) and use the NDI Video Monitor or Studio Monitor.
